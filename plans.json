        "Acute_plan": "##Abdominal pain\nPassing gas? Bowel movement? \nCheck for signs of peritonitis in physical exam\n~~Fever, N/V, abdominal distension?\nOrder KUB xrays to check for bowel obstruction\nOrder simethicone for gas pain\n\n##Altered mental status\nCheck for signs of stroke or hematoma\n~~Any lethargy, accompanied by numbness or tingling in extremities?\n~~Consult neuro and medicine, who will likely recommend a CT head. For acute episodes (e.g. SDH), likely workup will be placement into NSU for observation for waxing and waning mental status \n~~Make sure to inform PGY-4 or attending.\n\n##Antibiotics\nDo not reorder antibiotics overnight before checking with primary team or attending, especially for spine patients. \n~~In most cases, antibiotics can wait until morning\n~~The only time you should acutely begin antibiotics is for post-operative 24h antibiotics, in case these were missed.\n\nRed man syndrome from vancomycin\n~~Check vital status to assess stability\n~~Benadryl and ranitidine premedication\n\n##Arrythmia\nPlace order for continuous cardiac monitoring for any new onset arrhythmia\nConsult medicine for any new obset Afib\n\n##Chest pain\nThree major possibilities: MI, arrythmias, PE\nMI or arrythmias:\n~~Get EKG and troponins to rule out acute MI. \n~~If EKG is abnormal (any new MI or arrythmias), consult Sidagam or medicine \nPE:\n~~EKG not very sensitive or specific, so not useful\n~~What are physical symptoms? Red flags for PE are pleuritic chest pain (pain worse with breathing), tachypnea, tachycardia\n~~Any h/o PE? If yes, tell PGY-4 or attending (if during daytime) and have very low threshold for ordering a CT PE\n~~If CT PE positive, consult Sidagam or medicine\n\n##Code white\nUrgent floor issue. Patient must be present by patient, unless actively engaged in an emergent consult.\nExample: \n~~Story: POD 1 ACDF complains of neck pain. Code white called at 5AM due to \u2018SOB'. Patient hemodynamically stable and satting 97-99%. EKG normal sinus rhythm. JP drain 20output overnight.\n~~Concern here was for possible hematoma that could be causing neck pain, so our job was to check drain output.\n\n##Compartment syndrome\nAnytime there is concern, perform q4h NV checks.\nCheck recent surgical history - any fasciotomies performed? Which compartments?\nGet relevant labs - order CK and electrolytes\nDo not use Stryker needle!\n~~Diagnosis can be made on clinical grounds and labs\n~~IF compartment pressures must be measured, can do so with arterial line   \n\n##Dressing\nAquacells\n~~Get from core area in OR\n~~Repaint with chloraprep then put one back on\n\n##DVT\nHoman sign - forced dorsiflexion of foot will generate discomfort behind knee\nFor any suspicion, order a DVT scan\n~~If positive, consult Dr. Sidagam or medicine service\n\n##Electrolytes:\nReplete potassium overnight, make sure to follow up AM labs\n\n##Hematoma:\nIncreased firmness and tenderness around incision post-op?\n~~If overnight, make NPO after midnight, in case it's infected and needs possible I&D during the day\n\n##Infection:\nProfuse sweating and temperature fluctuation? UA/Ucx/Cxr to rule out infection\nConsult medicine for any confirmed infection - UTI, pneumonia, etc.\n\n##Pediatrics\nNeuro changes for spine and Hardesty baclofen patients:\n~~Check anesthesia dose and how patient did in PACU\n~~Initiated q4h neuro checks\n~~Example: Complained of paresthesias and weakness BLE after baclofen pump exchange. Had high doses of anesthesia and prolonged PACU stay. SILT w/ paresthesia BLE can wiggle toes but weak. On repeat exam able to flex knees to 30 deg.\n\n##Urinary issues\nDysuria? Order UA.\nUrinary retention? Follow post-void residuals, then place foley if post-void residuals are not <500cc after two trials of straight catherization, every 8 hours.",

There are also sterile traction bows if you can't find one there\n\u2022 Get the mini driver and battery x2 (ask the person in the core and they may have you sign it out)\n\u2022 You can also get a wire cutter for extra style points so you don't leave the sharp tip on the pin after you place it\n\u2022 In the ED (cabinet in trauma bay is easiest) get sterile gloves, chloraprep, a small scalpel (11 or 15 blade), some kerlix\n\u2022 Ideally transfer the patient to the hospital bed prior to doing the reduction and placing the traction pin  \n\u2022 If the bed does not arrive in a timely manner either do the reduction and hang traction off the end of the cart the patient is on, using stacks of blankets to prop up the rope and stabilize the leg; or tape the leg a shit ton to the other leg at the ankle/foot with a blanket in between the ankles\n\u2022 Place the traction bar setup on the hospital bed (simple frame at the foot of the bed with an extension that you angle off the bed away from the patient at approx 45 deg angle with the pulley at the top for the rope)\n\u2022 make your rope with loops at both ends, one loop needs to be large enough to fit over the key on the traction bow, the other just attaches to the hook on the weight carrier\n\u2022 do your reduction of the dislocated hip\n\u2022 you will often have someone holding traction on the foot for you while you do the next part since you just reduced the hip and it is likely unstable (main reason why you would do this in the first place) \n\u2022 if placing skeletal traction through the proximal tibia (not common) make sure to do a full knee ligamentous exam; if unstable, then no traction\n\u2022 placing blanket bumps under the entire leg will help elevate it so you have more of a straight shot across\n\u2022 palpate your landmarks on the leg, I like to mark things out (superior aspect of the patella and go 2-3 fingers proximal to that so you're out of the joint)\n\u2022 prep both the medial and lateral sides of the leg/distal femur; better to over prep so you can feel around and whatnot\n\u2022 make sure to look how the foot is sitting (int/ext rotation) so that when you pull traction and straighten the leg you don't then realize that you put your pin in at a 30 deg angle\n\u2022 make a knick in the skin on the medial side; only about 0.5cm (neurovascular structures over the posteromedial femur; which is why you go known to unknown)\n\u2022 spread down to bone with a hemostat (very small area)\n\u2022 place pin onto bone and feel the anterior and posterior borders of the femur, you want to center it \n\u2022 drive the pin through the bone parallel to the knee joint\n\u2022 when the pin starts to tent the skin on the lateral side, stop, make another very small knick in the skin, and finish driving the pin through\n\u2022 alternatively you can just stick the pin straight through skin down to bone and use a hemostat on the lateral side to tension the skin as it starts to poke through. If you do this make sure the skin isn't binding on the pin as your drill it through\n\u2022 lift the leg up by the pin and make sure it feels like the pin is through bone, and not just muscle/skin\n\u2022 tension the bow onto the pin by placing the pin ends in the slots and then turning the key on the end of it\n\u2022 attach the rope to the bow and the weights (usually about 20 lbs for an average adult)\n\u2022 slowly release manual traction on the leg now that you have the weights in place and make sure that you don't feel the hip slide back out\n\u2022 snip off the sharp end of the wire and dispose of it properly; you can cover the ends with blood collection tubes or the little sharps cover that comes in the ABG kit (nurse can get this for you)\n\u2022 wrap the ends of the wire between the bow and the leg with kerlix for padding\n\u2022 make sure the bow is not resting on the patient's anterior tibia (skin breakdown); may have to pad this with ABDs and/or adjust the angle of the pulley at the end of the bed\n\u2022 you can either get an AP pelvis to confirm reduction, or go straight to CT if you are confident\n\u2022 post-reduction CT; will likely have to help transfer the patient and maybe hold the traction while they get the CT\n\u2022 go see the other 3 consults that piled up while you were doing all that",

        "Injury_key": "night_float_guide",
        "Acute_plan": "<u><b>Night Float Schedule</b></u>\n5:30-5:45PM: Arrive at hospital, get dinner, shoot text to day float for pager.\n\n6PM-7PM: Receive sign-out from dayfloat and help them finish up.\n\n7PM-430AM: Consults. Update the email as you get consults. It helps to organize your thoughts, and for night float, you need to be able to come up with a plan as soon as you get the xrays. \n\n430AM: No matter how busy I am, generally come back up to the callroom to finish email. The 5:00 am email must go out ON TIME. It is a thing people will get mad about. If massive polytrauma rolls in 4:30 send the email earlier with the list of injuries for poly trauma and then leave it. If you're in a reduction, have the email on a computer all ready outside and just step out quickly send and back in. Usually you have a little time somewhere between 3-5 to get it completed. If not just stop what you're doing at 4:45 and get it out. \n\n5AM: Send email. \n\n545AM: Send group text via DocHalo to Dr. Sontich/Wetzel/Ochenjele about ALL operative cases. Even if there is nothing just tell them that so they know. Other big things they will want to know is if medically CLEAR. Basically a shortened version of the email. Just send tons of pics, they can figure the rest out and will ask for other stuff if they want it. I ended up making this text very short with just injuries and clearance with pictures. They will expect you to know things about cases added on during the day too, so be prepared. \n\n6AM-7AM: Staff all other consults, including operative consults to peds, hand, or spine. Honestly this can wait if you are still busy. But I'd try to get it all staffed around then prior to conference. Pretty much all of my staffing was via DocHalo. Just send pics/copy call email.\n \n7AM-8AM: Signout to dayfloat, finish up your work. Go to lecture only if all the other stuff is tied up.\n\n<u><b>Night Float General Information</b></u>\nThis is usually the trauma room schedule however it does change so I just texted them and asked who had trauma room. I also asked them if they wanted me to keep all trauma or just essentials (long bones, pelvis, tabs, etc).:\n\nMonday: Wetzel (unless GO or Sontich on call Sunday)\nTuesday: Wetzel\nWednesday: GO\nThursday: GO, sometimes Wetzel\nFriday: Sontich\n \nI usually just put all 3 trauma guys on the consent in addition to whoever is on call (if it\u2019s Gillespie etc). If on-call attending is a non-trauma staff, I also asked who the back-up is.\n   \nImportant things are making sure cases are set for OR, making sure you have all your appropriate imaging, and the email is done. Notes are the last thing. Just call trauma or ED and tell them what your current plan is. They understand! I tried to stay for conference as often as I could (prob made only 50% of the time). If I just had notes to finish I stayed and did them on my computer. However if there is still stuff to take care of I did that. If possible, try to post the notes after midnight - this way the dayfloat team does not have to round on the patient.\n\nTry to get patients admitted to services they were previously admitted to (family med, podiatry, vascular, etc.). For example, if the patient is being followed by family medicine in clinic (look in Portal), have the patient admitted to family med (just like how we admit patients that one of our spine attendings operated on, even when we are not on spine). Get geriatric involved for possible admission for elderly patients. \n \nThings to call about are very different depending who is on call. \n \nGeneral primary call - the usual emergencies and someone who isn't trauma I'd probably call about the 'protocol' emergencies (open fractures, femoral necks in young people, native hips if not back in). Just use judgement on like timing or ask 4. DO NOT wake up GO and Wetzel unless real emergency that you think needs OR prior to morning - never ended up asking Sontich his preference but I think he is a little more I should've been aware type. Pulseless extremity after reduction, going to OR with vascular, unstable pelvis obviously, Type 3B open or limb kind of hanging off, open knee dislocations that need ex fixes, big polytraumas I was happy to give a heads up on if like before midnight, otherwise use your judgement and call 4 if necessary. If you have any questions default to calling the 4. I called them multiple times at like 2-3am (however I always had a plan and things set in motion and just asked for some input). HOWEVER, bundle consults together before calling to minimize number of times you have to call. \n \nSpine - if any questions prior to 11ish would usually ask 4. You might get more comfortable and ask attending directly which I would do if I knew issue. Overnight I carefully considered my options, but like wake up the 4 and just ask do I need to call attending. Biggest thing I found was the changing factor were NEURO changes. Honestly if its operative its probably OK to call and they will just say not overnight. Biggest thing is that if it's not a trauma consult (i.e. no fractures), you need to have MRI before they can consult you. Explain that we are not a rule out service - anything and anything can cause someone to have bowel incontinence, not just cord compression. If you have any concerns or questions, or you get push back, speak with the spine attending before you see patients without imaging. This is how neurosurgery does it, and that's how we will do it. Sometimes they will do things like call for low back pain in a patient that Furey operated on like 2 months ago even when we\u2019re not on spine, so be sure to check to see if the patient has been seen by us if it\u2019s one of those kinds of consults.\n \nCall your PGY4 with any questions. I would wake them up on average once or twice a week with questions. HOWEVER, bundle consults together before calling to minimize number of times you have to call. I had a pretty low threshold. Just tell them your plan and if they think it\u2019s ok. Obviously have everything else teed up. Sometimes you just need to call the attending directly.\n\n<u><b>Communication</u></b>\nDr. Gordon is a big proponent of the SBAR approach to communication. SBAR stands for Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation. Below are two examples. Pertinent details only. Keep it simple and concise. Have all of your information available (labs, PMHx, baseline functional status, etc) when you make the call in case you are asked for them.\nS - Consult for ballistic diaphyseal femur fracture (vs. with vascular injury)...\nB - Patient is a 27 year-old otherwise healthy male who presented after single gunshot wound with isolated open neurovascularly intact right comminuted diaphyseal femur fracture...(vs the alternative: no dopplerable signal and CT angio showed transection of femoral artery)...\nA - Isolated NVI diaphyseal femur fracture in stable patient (vs. Isolated diaphyseal femur fracture with vascular injury requiring urgent repair)\nR - My plan is IV cefazolin, tetanus, traction pin placement and OR in AM for IMN (vs. IV cefazolin, tetanus, emergent ex fix followed by vascular repair OVN)",

        "Acute_plan": "<b>Guide to medicine and anesthesia consult, from Jamie Kyriakedenes:</b><br>\n1) <u><b>Cases that will ALWAYS be admitted to medicine</u></b>\n- Significant comorbidities that are a constant threat to life and your 'hunch' is that they will require preoperative diagnostics\n- Think ASA status 3-4. Use ASA score to give some context to medicine. <a href='https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/asa-physical-classification-system'>Link to ASA</a>\n- These include Echo for CHF that may be decompensating or stress test for new angina, EKG showing RVR or new afib, dialysis, acute hypoxia, needs syncopal workup, etc\n- These medically unstable patients always go to medicine\n\n2) <u><b>Cases that may be admitted to medicine vs Ortho+Dr.Sidagam* (see below)</u></b>\n- Patient has a list of comorbidities, but your hunch is that they are medically stable\n- Think ASA 2-3 patients. <a href='https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/asa-physical-classification-system'>Link to ASA</a>\n- These can include well-controlled DM, HTN, CKD, asthma, mild/stable CHF. Blood glucose isn't wildly out of control (not worried about DKA). SysBP isn't 200s. Some baseline SOB without acute worsening. Cr/BUN is somewhat elevated but at baseline, not new this admission. \n- These patients might need additional preoperative diagnostic studies, but it is not every time, thus requires more work-up:\n\n * A) <u>You choose to pursue admission to medicine.</u>\nIf you stop there and leave the hospital, the medicine team may not round on this patient until 1 pm, they then realize OSH records are needed, etc may not get around to clearing patient until the afternoon or later. Therefore, if you admit to medicine, personally call the medicine team (obtain pager # from ED) and let them know that we are trying to do the case at 10:00 am (or whatever our attending seems to indicate the order will be- ask chief if questions), and to please round on this patient FIRST, to plan to evaluate and optimize patient by that time, and let us know as soon as possible if they have concerns about the patient's ability to be taken to surgery that morning. Dr. Sidagam can also be involved in this situation, but the medicine attending should request and/or be aware of you involving Dr. Sidagam (per Sidagam).\n \n* B) <u>You choose to admit to Ortho and consult Dr. Sidagam for preoperative clearance (+/- postop comanagement).</u>\nYou must then either call Dr. Sidagam around 8:30-9 when he comes in (phone 66867), or CLEARLY sign this task out to the Dayfloat team (or other resident covering that new admission). In this situation (and actually likely either situation 1 or 2 for these sick patients), you would be wise to not expect a 730 first-start, and should temper expectations of the ortho-trauma attending accordingly.\n\n3) <u><b>Regarding calling anesthesia about a patient preoperatively:</u></b>\nYou should always call the anesthesiologist on-call overnight when you think a patient needs to go to OR that following MORNING (or you have high suspicion that our attending will try to take patient to OR that morning) and the patient has one of the following 'CARDIAC' CONDITIONS: \n\n- Heart (congestive heart failure, angina, history of heart attacks, valvular conditions [mitral or aortic regurgitation, aortic stenosis, etc.], arrthymias)\n- Cardiopulmonary (history of pulmonary embolism)\n- Cardiovascular (history of abdominal aortic aneurysm or aortic dissection)\n\nWe will continue to go back and forth with anesthesia on what is appropriate and what is not appropriate for overnight calls, and our current opinion is that cardiac/cardiovascular/cardiopulmonary issues most often cause delays in cases, and are important for them to start reviewing as soon as possible. Not infrequently, anesthesia may require further workup even though the medicine team 'cleared' a patient, which may delay the case. The conditions above frequently require comparing a current Echo or stress test to a previous Echo or stress test, so promptly call anesthesia about clearance. \n\n4) <u><b>From anesthesia, echocardiogram will be ordered in ED if:</b></u>\n- Clinically significant valvular disease (no echo within 1 year)\n- Systolic heart failure (no echo within 1 year)\n- Valvular heart disease or systolic heart failure with worsening symptoms\n- Symptoms suggestive of new-onset heart failure\n\n5) <b><u>Misc pre-operative requirements</b></u>\n- ALL HIP FRACTURE PATIENTS NEED A FOLEY\n- Keep checking clearance throughout the night and morning for all add-on cases, even if they are not going the next day! For instance, if it's Monday and dayfloat added a case for Thursday for Wetael, keep checking clearance because Wetzel might change his mind and decided to do the case on Tuesday\n- In fact, if patient going to OR in AM, put in foley\n- Pediatric patients do not need pre-operative labs (save them from a needle stick!)\n- In addition to T&S, prepare 2u of blood for hemiarthroplasty, amputation, pelvis/acetabulum surgeries, any other major surgeries\n",

Call your PGY4 ASAP: Its good to get them on board early just for a plan. They can also let the PGY5 know so they can plan to come to the OR if necessary. It is your responsibility to make sure the PGY5 is aware of the case. If the PGY5 tells you that they are not doing the case, and that the PGY4 is doing the case, it is then your responsibility to make sure the PGY4 is aware and updated accordingly with OR times, etc.\n2. Talk with the primary team/consulting services: Get a feel for if the patient is clear for the OR, as well as the plans from the other services. For example, Vascular surgery may want to do their repair first before Ortho provides an ex-fix (obviously a bit controversial, but who knows). \n3. Call the OR charge nurse and anesthesia attending: You need to call both people to see if a room is available, and if anesthesia is ok with running the case.\n4. Call the Attending: You should call the attending only after you know all of the other prior information. Confirm with the attending what implants they want, and if they want the rep available.\n5. Call the Rep: This is something the PGY4 might do, but it is still your responsibility to confirm they do this, or you do it yourself. I talked to the Synthes Head Rep and for anytime Synthes is used, he said to call his cell 24/7. If he isn\u2019t on call, his voicemail will give the contact info for the rep on call. I\u2019m not sure how the call schedule for Stryker works. \n6. Transfer the Patient to the OR: You have to coordinate this with the OR control desk. They will get mad if you bring the patient too early. ",
