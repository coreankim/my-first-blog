        "Acute_plan_checklist": "\u2022 Find ED charge nurse and have them work on getting a hospital bed; tell them the patient can NOT leave the ED until this happens\n\u2022 Find trauma/ED resident and nurse taking care of patient to start coordinating sedation\n\u2022 Call (page?) 30455 yourself to work on getting the bed (has not worked on the weekends for me)\n\u2022 Call 43401 to have the traction cart brought up to the ED (there may also be traction setups in the Lakeside 60 call room and/or Tower 6 call room)\n\u2022 Order a portable scout XR of the knee to ensure you aren't about to place traction through a distal femur fx\n\u2022 Go to the OR and get 2 smooth steinmann pins/wires (2.2mm) which are individually peel packed and on a rack across from rooms 6/7 in the core\n\u2022 If the patient has a huge leg you may need to open the Synthes 6.5 set to get out the longer 2.8 steinmann pin\n\u2022 There is also a big metal drawer/tool chest looking thing in the core between OR 6/7, the traction bows are in the bottom drawer, grab one of those. There are also sterile traction bows if you can't find one there\n\u2022 Get the mini driver and battery x2 (ask the person in the core and they may have you sign it out)\n\u2022 You can also get a wire cutter for extra style points so you don't leave the sharp tip on the pin after you place it\n\u2022 In the ED (cabinet in trauma bay is easiest) get sterile gloves, chloraprep, a small scalpel (11 or 15 blade), some kerlix\n\u2022 Ideally transfer the patient to the hospital bed prior to doing the reduction and placing the traction pin  \n\u2022 If the bed does not arrive in a timely manner either do the reduction and hang traction off the end of the cart the patient is on, using stacks of blankets to prop up the rope and stabilize the leg; or tape the leg a shit ton to the other leg at the ankle/foot with a blanket in between the ankles\n\u2022 Place the traction bar setup on the hospital bed (simple frame at the foot of the bed with an extension that you angle off the bed away from the patient at approx 45 deg angle with the pulley at the top for the rope)\n\u2022 make your rope with loops at both ends, one loop needs to be large enough to fit over the key on the traction bow, the other just attaches to the hook on the weight carrier\n\u2022 do your reduction of the dislocated hip\n\u2022 you will often have someone holding traction on the foot for you while you do the next part since you just reduced the hip and it is likely unstable (main reason why you would do this in the first place) \n\u2022 if placing skeletal traction through the proximal tibia (not common) make sure to do a full knee ligamentous exam; if unstable, then no traction\n\u2022 placing blanket bumps under the entire leg will help elevate it so you have more of a straight shot across\n\u2022 palpate your landmarks on the leg, I like to mark things out (superior aspect of the patella and go 2-3 fingers proximal to that so you're out of the joint)\n\u2022 prep both the medial and lateral sides of the leg/distal femur; better to over prep so you can feel around and whatnot\n\u2022 make sure to look how the foot is sitting (int/ext rotation) so that when you pull traction and straighten the leg you don't then realize that you put your pin in at a 30 deg angle\n\u2022 make a knick in the skin on the medial side; only about 0.5cm (neurovascular structures over the posteromedial femur; which is why you go known to unknown)\n\u2022 spread down to bone with a hemostat (very small area)\n\u2022 place pin onto bone and feel the anterior and posterior borders of the femur, you want to center it \n\u2022 drive the pin through the bone parallel to the knee joint\n\u2022 when the pin starts to tent the skin on the lateral side, stop, make another very small knick in the skin, and finish driving the pin through\n\u2022 alternatively you can just stick the pin straight through skin down to bone and use a hemostat on the lateral side to tension the skin as it starts to poke through. If you do this make sure the skin isn't binding on the pin as your drill it through\n\u2022 lift the leg up by the pin and make sure it feels like the pin is through bone, and not just muscle/skin\n\u2022 tension the bow onto the pin by placing the pin ends in the slots and then turning the key on the end of it\n\u2022 attach the rope to the bow and the weights (usually about 20 lbs for an average adult)\n\u2022 slowly release manual traction on the leg now that you have the weights in place and make sure that you don't feel the hip slide back out\n\u2022 snip off the sharp end of the wire and dispose of it properly; you can cover the ends with blood collection tubes or the little sharps cover that comes in the ABG kit (nurse can get this for you)\n\u2022 wrap the ends of the wire between the bow and the leg with kerlix for padding\n\u2022 make sure the bow is not resting on the patient's anterior tibia (skin breakdown); may have to pad this with ABDs and/or adjust the angle of the pulley at the end of the bed\n\u2022 you can either get an AP pelvis to confirm reduction, or go straight to CT if you are confident\n\u2022 post-reduction CT; will likely have to help transfer the patient and maybe hold the traction while they get the CT\n\u2022 go see the other 3 consults that piled up while you were doing all that",
