There are also sterile traction bows if you can't find one there\n\u2022 Get the mini driver and battery x2 (ask the person in the core and they may have you sign it out)\n\u2022 You can also get a wire cutter for extra style points so you don't leave the sharp tip on the pin after you place it\n\u2022 In the ED (cabinet in trauma bay is easiest) get sterile gloves, chloraprep, a small scalpel (11 or 15 blade), some kerlix\n\u2022 Ideally transfer the patient to the hospital bed prior to doing the reduction and placing the traction pin  \n\u2022 If the bed does not arrive in a timely manner either do the reduction and hang traction off the end of the cart the patient is on, using stacks of blankets to prop up the rope and stabilize the leg; or tape the leg a shit ton to the other leg at the ankle/foot with a blanket in between the ankles\n\u2022 Place the traction bar setup on the hospital bed (simple frame at the foot of the bed with an extension that you angle off the bed away from the patient at approx 45 deg angle with the pulley at the top for the rope)\n\u2022 make your rope with loops at both ends, one loop needs to be large enough to fit over the key on the traction bow, the other just attaches to the hook on the weight carrier\n\u2022 do your reduction of the dislocated hip\n\u2022 you will often have someone holding traction on the foot for you while you do the next part since you just reduced the hip and it is likely unstable (main reason why you would do this in the first place) \n\u2022 if placing skeletal traction through the proximal tibia (not common) make sure to do a full knee ligamentous exam; if unstable, then no traction\n\u2022 placing blanket bumps under the entire leg will help elevate it so you have more of a straight shot across\n\u2022 palpate your landmarks on the leg, I like to mark things out (superior aspect of the patella and go 2-3 fingers proximal to that so you're out of the joint)\n\u2022 prep both the medial and lateral sides of the leg/distal femur; better to over prep so you can feel around and whatnot\n\u2022 make sure to look how the foot is sitting (int/ext rotation) so that when you pull traction and straighten the leg you don't then realize that you put your pin in at a 30 deg angle\n\u2022 make a knick in the skin on the medial side; only about 0.5cm (neurovascular structures over the posteromedial femur; which is why you go known to unknown)\n\u2022 spread down to bone with a hemostat (very small area)\n\u2022 place pin onto bone and feel the anterior and posterior borders of the femur, you want to center it \n\u2022 drive the pin through the bone parallel to the knee joint\n\u2022 when the pin starts to tent the skin on the lateral side, stop, make another very small knick in the skin, and finish driving the pin through\n\u2022 alternatively you can just stick the pin straight through skin down to bone and use a hemostat on the lateral side to tension the skin as it starts to poke through. If you do this make sure the skin isn't binding on the pin as your drill it through\n\u2022 lift the leg up by the pin and make sure it feels like the pin is through bone, and not just muscle/skin\n\u2022 tension the bow onto the pin by placing the pin ends in the slots and then turning the key on the end of it\n\u2022 attach the rope to the bow and the weights (usually about 20 lbs for an average adult)\n\u2022 slowly release manual traction on the leg now that you have the weights in place and make sure that you don't feel the hip slide back out\n\u2022 snip off the sharp end of the wire and dispose of it properly; you can cover the ends with blood collection tubes or the little sharps cover that comes in the ABG kit (nurse can get this for you)\n\u2022 wrap the ends of the wire between the bow and the leg with kerlix for padding\n\u2022 make sure the bow is not resting on the patient's anterior tibia (skin breakdown); may have to pad this with ABDs and/or adjust the angle of the pulley at the end of the bed\n\u2022 you can either get an AP pelvis to confirm reduction, or go straight to CT if you are confident\n\u2022 post-reduction CT; will likely have to help transfer the patient and maybe hold the traction while they get the CT\n\u2022 go see the other 3 consults that piled up while you were doing all that",

        "Acute_plan": "<u><b>Daily Schedule</b></u>\n6PM-7PM: Receive sign-out from dayfloat and help them finish up.\n7PM-430AM: Consults.\n430AM: No matter how busy I am, generally come back up to the callroom to finish email.\n5AM: Send email.\n545AM: Send group text via DocHalo to Dr. Sontich/Wetzel/Ochenjele about operative traumas. Just send pictures, and I usually copy the HPI/Plan from my call email. They will expect you to know things about cases added on during the day too, so be prepared.\n6AM-7AM: Staff your consults with the attendings. Pretty much all of my staffing was via DocHalo. Just send pics/copy call email.\n7AM-8AM: Signout to dayfloat, finish up your work. Go to lecture only if all the other stuff is tied up.\n\n<u><b>Who to call and when to \u201cstaff\u201d consults (Modified from the guide by Doug Weinberg):</u></b>\nThis is always confusing for everyone involved.  You will probably try to handle as much as you can on your own, without \u201cbothering\u201d as many people as possible. While we can all appreciate this mindset, always know that there is someone more experienced than you available to help.  \n\nPlease note, however, that at the end of the day you have to be the one to staff all of your consults with the attending. We cannot do this for you as we have usually not seen the patient. Therefore, hopefully the following set of rules will assist in efficiently staffing patients: \n\n1) You must staff all patients seen during your call with each attending on call, including ones that had no consults that day for their particular specialty. A DocHalo text or secured email after your call shift or in the morning of night float usually suffices. The morning emails must be sent <b>BY 5AM on weekdays, BY 6AM on weekends</b> so other services can coordinate rounding on the new patients from call. The night emails can be sent a bit later, since services won't be rounding on the new patients, but try to send them out by 6-7pm if you are not getting too crushed.\n\n2) NEVER FEEL BAD ABOUT CALLING THE ATTENDING (no matter what time\u2026) - THEY ARE ON CALL TOO, and they would rather know about the consults than waking up in the morning without that knowledge.\n \n3) While almost all attending\u2019s and residents would prefer a DocHalo or phone call over a page, remember, that paging is still sometimes the best way to reach people emergently, especially in the middle of the night. If you don\u2019t get a response on the phone, and you need an urgent answer, don\u2019t just wait for the attending/senior resident to call back. Stuff happens with cell phones, and some people might not hear a text or call in the middle of the night. Pagers are impossible to ignore. Its super easy to use the UH directory to lookup someone\u2019s pager and type in your page. At the very least, this usually wakes people up enough to have them check their phones.\n \n4) In general, the rules for the other members of the call team (aside from you) are as follows:\n1. <u>Attending</u>: Makes all decisions regarding operative consults, makes important decisions on floor patients.\n\n2. <u>PGY5, i.e. the Chiefs</u>: Organizes OR coverage and covers cases they are interested in or needed for.  Calls implant reps or assigns it to the PGY4.\n \nChiefs must be aware of all call cases, but should rarely, if ever, be your first call for things that come up while you are on call (at UH at least). Remember that Chiefs are on call essentially every other day, and have a lot of administrative responsibilities as well - try to be respectful of their time, especially when you are at Metro without a PGY4 buffer. While at Metro, you should call the spine fellow/hand fellow/or hand resident for issues on those respective consults.\n \n3. <u>PGY4</u>: Covers cases as assigned by the PGY5, ensures implant availability along with PGY5. They are available to answer questions from PGY2.\n  \n5) If there is ever a question of whether \u201csomething needs to go to the OR\u201d the attending will ultimately make that decision. The PGY4s on-call are always available to discuss the case first if you are unsure before calling the attending. We would recommend you do so routinely early on in the year, especially during awake hours. Remember, don\u2019t ever feel bad about calling the attendings, as they are on call and ultimately responsible.  However, when you do call them make sure you have a clear and succinct story rehearsed in your mind (i.e. SBAR, see below).  You should also have a plan (whether right or wrong) and if operative, you need to know the OR availability, NPO time, and medical clearance.  You should not serve simply as a reporter.  Especially as you move on later in the year, try to take things to the next level and think beyond your training level by considering operative vs. non-op, emergent versus next day, operative technique including approach, positioning, table, instruments and implants.  \n\n6) Attendings and seniors often need a picture to help with the decision-making. Take pictures of xrays, important slices on CT/MRI, open wounds and infections so you can securely text them by DocHalo. Don\u2019t send PHI. You can also take videos of CT/MRIs. Always make sure that you get a followup text from the person on the other end to ensure they got your message if it contains critical stuff.\n\n7) A couple hypothetical case examples as follows:\n\n<i>EXAMPLE 1:</i>\nIts 2AM. You get consulted on a patient for flexor tenosynovitis. You see the patient, and determine they have 4/4 Kanavel's signs - something that you can hopefully do without too much assistance. Obviously you realize this is a potentially operative consult. You should start preparing accordingly, get pre op labs (CBC, BMP, Coags, T&S, EKG, CXR if CT Chest not available, urinalysis if hardware to be implanted, b-HCG if appropriate), make sure the patient is NPO, try to get a sense from the OR how busy they are (they may frown upon this, but try to be tactful, because the attending will want to know).  At this point, you are ready to staff the consult. Who should you call next? This is a question regarding OR, so you should call the attending. Neither a chief nor PGY4 can tell you it\u2019s ok to \u201csit on it\u201d with IV ABX until AM, and obviously, they can\u2019t staff a case without an attending. So unless you have a question about the workup/diagnosis, etc., there is no reason to call them at this point. \n \n<i>EXAMPLE 2:</i>\nA patient with a pelvic ring injury comes in. You look at the XR and have no clue what is going on. The XR quality is terrible because the patient is rotated, but it\u2019s the best that they can do because the patient is hemodynamically unstable and crashing in the trauma bay. You are trying to remain calm out but they tell you they just initiated massive transfusion protocol. Apparently Gen Surg is wanting to take patient to OR for an ex-lap. At this point, you are also drowning in other consults, flustered, and not sure if you need to put a pelvic binder. Meanwhile, to fluster you further, some trauma attending shouts at you asking if you are going to put in a traction pin.  This is obviously a serious issue, and time is of the essence. Take a deep breath, organize your thoughts, make sure you have x rays, go to a quiet location where you actually have good service, and then call the PGY4. They are available for complicated questions like this, and will direct you accordingly. Ultimately, you will probably end up having to call the attending on this one, but if you are confused about the workup, diagnoses, etc, the PGY4 is there to help you.\n \n<i>EXAMPLE 3:</i>\nA patient comes in with a hip fracture at 2AM. You are able to tell that it is an intertroch fracture with an unstable pattern, you are almost positive that the attending on call the next day is going to want to use an IMN. You complete the workup of the patient, and it seems that this one is straightforward: patient is healthy, no other injuries, really no reason the case couldn\u2019t be cleared for OR in the AM. You even got a manual traction view to help clarify the fracture pattern, and yeah, you were right, this injury is unstable, has some posterior medial comminution and extends sub-trochanteric. You call the trauma anesthesiologist on call to just quickly discuss the case and patient with them. You probably woke them up and you apologize, but you would both agree that it's better for patient care to optimize the patient for the OR. They tell you the case will be cleared for the morning. At this point you finish making sure you have all the appropriate imaging, labs, is marked, consented, and added on. You use your previous Collier Call Worksheet to keep yourself organized, and double check that you haven\u2019t missed anything.  While calling the OR control desk, they tell you that the case should be a first start in the trauma room for the morning. Great. At this point, its probably been at least an hour, maybe 3AM right now. You have this patient ready for the AM, you don\u2019t really have any urgent questions that can\u2019t wait a couple hours, and look at you, you even remembered to fill out the pre op HandP, pre op checklist, and put in the XRay order for surgery. You feel great, like a young Mike Tyson.\n\nYour only real question is what implant the attending is going to use and who is going to cover the case (maybe even with you doing most of it it since you and your handy Collier worksheet are coming through big time on this one). Although you remember questions like those are above your paygrade, and will have to be addressed by the more important people in the AM, so you take your best guess and tell the OR synthes because that\u2019s what you thought you remembered Dr. Wetzel using for a similar fracture in the past. So you then prepare your signout email for the AM, filling in the blanks from earlier. The chiefs and attendings will want to know about add ons before your email comes out, so you plan on sending the attending a little 545 or 6 AM wakeup DocHalo confirming they want the first start and double checking you got the implant right. However, lucky you, you actually get a text from the attending\u2014half asleep but wondering if they have any cases that day\u2014at 530 AM asking you how the night was and if you added anything on. You then realize they don\u2019t really care how your night was, they are just wondering what they need to do for the day. But no worries, you had your \u201cCollier Call Worksheet\u201d with you all night and the \u201cNapora Common Call Consults\u201d sheet, so you\u2014still covered in sweat and tears\u2014think to yourself \u201cI had a pretty good night last night, thanks for asking.\u201d You then snap back to reality, and either call them or text them details of the case, and go from there. They will usually tell you what implant they want (if they don\u2019t, you must press them for this! or will defer to the chief or PGY4, in which case, make sure you pass along any of that information to the chief/pgy4 involved.\n\nRemember, ensuring that a patient gets to the OR appropriately is almost your most important job while on call, all the while making sure your patients are given good care.\n\n<u><b>Communication</u></b>\nDr. Gordon is a big proponent of the SBAR approach to communication. SBAR stands for Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation. Below are two examples. Pertinent details only. Keep it simple and concise. Have all of your information available (labs, PMHx, baseline functional status, etc) when you make the call in case you are asked for them.\nS - \u201cConsult for ballistic diaphyseal femur fracture (vs. with vascular injury)...\nB - Patient is a 27 year-old otherwise healthy male who presented after single gunshot wound with isolated open neurovascularly intact right comminuted diaphyseal femur fracture...(vs the alternative: no dopplerable signal and CT angio showed transection of femoral artery)...\nA - Isolated NVI diaphyseal femur fracture in stable patient (vs. Isolated diaphyseal femur fracture with vascular injury requiring urgent repair)\nR - My plan is IV cefazolin, tetanus, traction pin placement and OR in AM for IMN (vs. IV cefazolin, tetanus, emergent ex fix followed by vascular repair OVN)",

Think ASA status 3-4. <u><a href='https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/asa-physical-classification-system'>Link to ASA</a></u>\n\n#2)<u><b> Cases that may be admitted to medicine vs Ortho+Dr.Sidagam* (see below)</u></b>\n- Patient has a list of comorbidities, but your hunch is that they are medically stable\n- These can include well-controlled DM, HTN, CKD, asthma, mild/stable CHF. Blood glucose isn't wildly out of control (not worried about DKA). SysBP isn't 200s. Some baseline SOB without acute worsening. Cr/BUN is somewhat elevated but at baseline, not new this admission. You get the point, think ASA 2-3 patients. \n- These patients might need additional preoperative diagnostic studies, but it is not every time, thus requires more work-up:\n\n * A) <u>You choose to pursue admission to medicine.</u>\nIf you stop there and leave the hospital, the medicine team may not round on this patient until 1 pm, they then realize OSH records are needed, etc may not get around to clearing patient until the afternoon or later. Therefore, if you admit to medicine, personally call the medicine team (obtain pager # from ED) and let them know that we are trying to do the case at 10:00 am (or whatever our attending seems to indicate the order will be- ask chief if questions), and to please round on this patient FIRST, to plan to evaluate and optimize patient by that time, and let us know as soon as possible if they have concerns about the patient's ability to be taken to surgery that morning. Dr. Sidagam can also be involved in this situation, but the medicine attending should request and/or be aware of you involving Dr. Sidagam (per Sidagam).\n \n* B) <u>You choose to admit to Ortho and consult Dr. Sidagam for preoperative clearance (+/- postop comanagement).</u>\nYou must then either call Dr. Sidagam around 8:30-9 when he comes in (phone 66867), or CLEARLY sign this task out to the Dayfloat team (or other resident covering that new admission). In this situation (and actually likely either situation 1 or 2 for these sick patients), you would be wise to not expect a 730 first-start, and should temper expectations of the ortho-trauma attending accordingly.\n\n#3) <u><b>Regarding calling anesthesia about a patient preoperatively:</u></b>\nYou should always call the anesthesiologist on-call overnight when you think a patient needs to go to OR that following MORNING (or you have high suspicion that our attending will try to take patient to OR that morning..) and the patient has one of the \"\"CARDIAC\"\" CONDITIONS* below that you feel \"\"might\"\" require further workup. We will continue to go back and forth with anesthesia on what is appropriate and what is not appropriate for overnight calls, and our current opinion is that cardiac/cardiovascular/cardiopulmonary issues most often cause delays in cases, and are important for them to start reviewing as soon as possible. Not infrequently, anesthesia may require further workup even though the medicine team \"\"cleared\"\" a patient, which may delay the case. These conditions frequently require comparing a current Echo or stress test to a previous Echo or stress test. From now on, please call anesthesia overnight when the patient has one of the CARDIAC CONDITIONS below:\n\n* CARDIAC= \n- heart (congestive heart failure, angina, history of heart attacks, valvular conditions [mitral or aortic regurgitation, aortic stenosis, etc.], arrthymias)\n- Cardiopulmonary (history of pulmonary embolism)\n- Cardiovascular (history of abdominal aortic aneurysm or aortic dissection)\n\n<b><u>Misc pre-operative requirements</b></u>\nALL HIP FRACTURE PATIENTS NEED A FOLEY\nPediatric patients do not need pre-operative labs (save them from a needle stick!)\nT&S??\nSugartong = show actual picture, of patient's motion; \nShort leg splint = neutral flexion, everything gets a splint\nBundle consults together before calling\nJoint aspiration - need lavadner top tubes\n\"",

        "Acute_plan": "Lets say you get a pulseless knee dislocation that you know needs to go to the OR ASAP. After initial assessment, you need to quickly and carefully plan what you\u2019re going to do next because there are a lot of ways for things to not go efficiently in this scenario.\n\n1. Call your PGY4 ASAP: Its good to get them on board early just for a plan. They can also let the PGY5 know so they can plan to come to the OR if necessary. It is your responsibility to make sure the PGY5 is aware of the case. If the PGY5 tells you that they are not doing the case, and that the PGY4 is doing the case, it is then your responsibility to make sure the PGY4 is aware and updated accordingly with OR times, etc.\n2. Talk with the primary team/consulting services: Get a feel for if the patient is clear for the OR, as well as the plans from the other services. For example, Vascular surgery may want to do their repair first before Ortho provides an ex-fix (obviously a bit controversial, but who knows). \n3. Call the OR charge nurse and anesthesia attending: You need to call both people to see if a room is available, and if anesthesia is ok with running the case.\n4. Call the Attending: You should call the attending only after you know all of the other prior information. Confirm with the attending what implants they want, and if they want the rep available.\n5. Call the Rep: This is something the PGY4 might do, but it is still your responsibility to confirm they do this, or you do it yourself. I talked to the Synthes Head Rep and for anytime Synthes is used, he said to call his cell 24/7. If he isn\u2019t on call, his voicemail will give the contact info for the rep on call. I\u2019m not sure how the call schedule for Stryker works. \n6. Transfer the Patient to the OR: You have to coordinate this with the OR control desk. They will get mad if you bring the patient too early. ",
